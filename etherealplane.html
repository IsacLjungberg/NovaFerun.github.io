<h1>Ethereal Plane</h1>
The ethereal plane is the realm of disembodied souls, certain rare creatures, and fairly powerful spellcasters able to transport themselves to it. There exist paths between the border ethereal and other planes, being a sort of gateway to other planes. In the border ethereal, a creature can see into the material plane, although it appears faint and blurred and can only be seen to a certain distance. There is no gravity, and creatures move by willing themselves along (at their normal walking speed), or flying. Creatures in the ethereal can move through solid structures in the material without hindrance, with the exception of certain special or magical materials.
<br><br>

While in between the border ethereal and the material, a creature can phase through solid objects on the material, but takes 1d10 force damage if it stops inside of one. A creature in this state has resistance to nonmagical damage, and nonmagical damage they cause deals half damage to material creatures and ethereal creatures.
