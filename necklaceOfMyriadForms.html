<h1>Necklace of Myriad Forms</h1>
<i>Wondrous Item, Rare (requires attunement)</i>
This necklace is made out of a variety of strange bones inscribed with druidic sigils and tied together with string and sinew.
<br><br>
These bones are taken from a variety of bestial creatures, most often monstrosities, and are imbued with their essence. A creature that can transform themselves or others into beasts (such as by the druid ability wildshape or the polymorph spell) can ignore the "beast" restriction of these features, and instead choose to transform into any of the creatures of which the necklace contains the essence. All other restrictions, such as those restricting CR, still apply.
<br><br>
The necklace can hold most creatures with bones that do not exceed CR 7, and it may even be possible to weave new bones into the item if they adhere to this restriction. The difficulty of this is dependant on the magical properties of the creature. This particular necklace contains the following creatures:
<ul>
<li>Lemure (0)</li>
<li>Gremishka (1/8)</li>
<li>Goblin (CR 1/4)</li>
<li>Lizardfolk (CR 1/2)</li>
<li>Fire snake (CR 1)</li>
<li>Mimic (CR 2)</li>
<li>Trapper (CR 3)</li>
<li>Blue Slaad (CR 7)</li>
</ul>
