<h1>Hag's Tooth</h1>
<i>Wondrous Item, Rare</i><br>
This fang like piece of metal is given by a night hag to her disciples to grant them a portion of her power, allowing them to traverse the ethereal plane. A creature holding the tooth who is aware of its properties can speak an incantation and perform gestures over the course of a minute (as if casting a spell with verbal and somatic components). At the end of the minute the creature may transport itself, and one willing creature it can touch, to the border ethereal, or to into a state in between the border ethereal and the material. While on the border ethereal or the in-between the creature can perform the ritual in the same way to yet again transport themselves.<br><br>

<i>Curse of knowledge:</i> The item is cursed to prevent creatures from stealing and using it. A creature that attempts to magically identify the tooth takes 2d10 psychic damage and must make a DC 15 intelligence save. On a successful save they learn how to use the item and its properties, and on a fail they do not.
